Title: Simulate dynamics on networks
Author: Neil G. MacLaren [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Neil G. MacLaren <neil.g.maclaren@gmail.com>
Imports: stats, parallel, deSolve
Suggests: igraph
Description: Simulate dynamics, possibly on networks, using ordinary or stochastic differential equations. Relies on deSolve for ODEs. For SDEs, uses a simple Euler-Maruyama implementation to produce an object like the output from deSolve::ode().
